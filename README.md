# 📋✨ Course Registration Form | HTML + CSS

Welcome to the **Course Registration Form** project! 🚀
This project demonstrates a fully responsive and aesthetically styled **registration form** using only **HTML5** and **CSS3**. Designed to simulate a modern course enrollment interface, it includes a vibrant UI, interactive validations, custom styling, and accessibility features — perfect for beginners looking to level up their frontend skills! 💻🎨

## 🧩 Features

✅ **Multi-section form structure**
✅ **Personal & Course details input**
✅ **Real-time validations for email, password & number fields**
✅ **Interactive tooltips & icon-based feedback system**
✅ **Range slider to rate coding knowledge**
✅ **File upload functionality**
✅ **Responsive styling using gradients, hover/focus states**
✅ **Custom radio buttons & dropdowns**
✅ **Form Reset & Submit capabilities**

## 🌈 Technologies Used

* 🧾 **HTML5** — Structure & semantics
* 🎨 **CSS3** — Styling, gradients, form UX enhancements

## 💡 How It Works

1. Users fill in their **personal information** like name, age, gender, etc.
2. They select the **course**, mode of delivery (online/offline), and enter optional comments.
3. The form includes **field-level validations**, feedback icons, and placeholder hints.
4. **Submit** button triggers the data collection (you can later connect this with JavaScript or backend).
5. **Reset** clears the form fields for fresh input.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

* Using semantic HTML to structure forms
* Styling form controls with CSS
* Creating interactive and user-friendly UI elements
* Validating inputs using HTML attributes
* Enhancing accessibility and form flow

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* 🔐 Add JavaScript-based dynamic validations
* 📨 Connect form data to a backend (Node.js / PHP / Firebase)
* 📊 Store and display submitted data using localStorage or a database
* 🎭 Improve animations and transitions
